# [297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree][link] (Hard)

[link]: https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so
that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to
be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your
serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can
be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary
tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/32442719377939-How-to-create-test-cases-on-
LeetCode#h_01J5EGREAW3NAEJ14XC07GRW1A). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please
be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10⁴]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
